Unifying PCB expansion for Balthazar 

Single PCB solution for connecting the three previously designed Balthazar modules (I/O, power supply, USB 2.0, 3.0 controllers, keyboard and adding Compute Module compatible FPGA boards. Aimed at setting a compatibility standard to widely accepted hardware standards.
It has standardized 100 pin accomodating module for adding standard CM HAT modules based on ARM or FPGA 
It has GPIO expansion port, HDMI,2x USB 3.0, Ethernet RJ45 and a microSD card slot.  

It is designed to accomodate ULX4M-CM4-HAT designed by Radiona.org using HDR 100 POS SMT board to board mezzanine connectors.
